Go to http://bnci-horizon-2020.eu/database/data-sets and download 1 or more files from "18. AMUSE - an auditory speller based on spatial hearing (009-2015)"

- EEG_MatlabCode: Use my Matlab function to process the AMUSE EEG signals, so they look exactly as they should look. The variables' name is very important for the execution of the program. If you know what you are doing, go on and make your oun program.

- Now, check the python code named "myCode.py" and move the generated datasets in the right folder.
